Here is a list of the projects currently available in this repository:

1. *Sign up Applicatiom* - a user registration application. This will allow users to register with the system, providing both their name and age, and we'll store this information in our own custom type. We'll also provide the ability for a user to be looked up by an ID, retrieving their information.


Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a README file with detailed information on how to build and run the project.

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the executable from the command line. For example:
